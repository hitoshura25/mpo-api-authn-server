# Client Library Publishing Integration

## Overview

This document describes the integration of client library publishing capabilities into the `main-branch-post-processing.yml` workflow. The implementation adds automated publishing of both TypeScript and Android client libraries on main branch merges.

## Implementation Details

### Environment Variables Added

```yaml
# Client Library Publishing Configuration
BASE_VERSION: "1.0"
NPM_SCOPE: "@vmenon25"
NPM_PACKAGE_NAME: "mpo-webauthn-client"
```

These centralized configuration variables ensure consistent package naming and versioning across both TypeScript and Android clients.

### New Jobs Added

#### 1. `publish-typescript-client`
- **Trigger**: Only on successful CI/CD completion (`github.event.workflow_run.conclusion == 'success'`)
- **Permissions**: `contents: read`, `packages: write`
- **Key Steps**:
  - Generate version using `scripts/core/version-manager.sh`
  - Generate TypeScript client from OpenAPI spec
  - Build npm package with proper metadata
  - Publish to npm registry using `secrets.NPM_PUBLISH_TOKEN`
  - Create GitHub release for production versions

#### 2. `publish-android-client`
- **Trigger**: Only on successful CI/CD completion (`github.event.workflow_run.conclusion == 'success'`)
- **Permissions**: `contents: read`, `packages: write`
- **Key Steps**:
  - Generate version using `scripts/core/version-manager.sh`
  - Generate Android client from OpenAPI spec
  - Build and publish to GitHub Packages
  - Create GitHub release for production versions

### Parallel Execution Design

Both client publishing jobs run **in parallel** and are **independent** of:
- Docker publishing operations
- Each other
- Security scanning (they run regardless of scan results)

This design ensures:
- **Faster execution**: No unnecessary dependencies between client libraries
- **Resilience**: One library can publish even if the other fails
- **Efficiency**: Client publishing doesn't block Docker operations

### Enhanced Status Reporting

The `report-post-processing-status` job was updated to include:
- Individual status reporting for TypeScript and Android client publishing
- Comprehensive success/failure analysis
- Better error handling with detailed job status breakdown

### Version Management

Both jobs use the unified version manager (`scripts/core/version-manager.sh`) which:
- Generates semantic versions based on build number
- Supports prerelease identification
- Maintains consistent versioning across platforms

### Package.json Generation

The TypeScript client publishing uses a placeholder-based approach to avoid YAML syntax conflicts:

```bash
# Generate package.json with placeholders
cat > package.json << 'EOF'
{
  "name": "PACKAGE_NAME_PLACEHOLDER",
  "version": "CLIENT_VERSION_PLACEHOLDER",
  ...
}
EOF

# Replace placeholders with actual values
sed -i "s/PACKAGE_NAME_PLACEHOLDER/$PACKAGE_NAME/g" package.json
sed -i "s/CLIENT_VERSION_PLACEHOLDER/$CLIENT_VERSION/g" package.json
```

This approach ensures proper YAML parsing while maintaining dynamic value injection.

## Integration Benefits

1. **Automated Publishing**: Client libraries are published automatically on main branch merges
2. **Centralized Configuration**: Single point of control for package naming and versioning
3. **Parallel Efficiency**: Independent execution prevents bottlenecks
4. **Comprehensive Reporting**: Detailed status tracking for all post-processing operations
5. **Error Resilience**: Individual job failures don't block other operations

## Secrets Required

### TypeScript Publishing
- `NPM_PUBLISH_TOKEN`: npm registry authentication token

### Android Publishing
- `GITHUB_TOKEN`: Automatically provided by GitHub Actions for GitHub Packages

## Release Creation

Both jobs create GitHub releases for production versions (non-prereleases) with:
- **TypeScript**: Tag format `npm-client-v{version}`
- **Android**: Tag format `android-client-v{version}`
- Comprehensive release notes with installation instructions
- Usage examples and documentation links

## Workflow Architecture

```
main-branch-post-processing.yml
├── detect-changes (conditional)
├── docker-security-scan (conditional)
├── ai-security-analysis (conditional)
├── publish-dockerhub (conditional)
├── publish-typescript-client (parallel, main-branch only)
├── publish-android-client (parallel, main-branch only)
├── cleanup-ghcr (always)
├── tag-repository (conditional)
└── report-post-processing-status (always)
```

The client publishing jobs run in parallel with Docker operations, ensuring efficient resource utilization and faster overall execution times.
