# AI Security Analysis - Sharing Philosophy .gitignore
#
# This .gitignore reflects our architectural decision to separate:
# - Valuable, reusable artifacts (shared externally)  
# - Temporary, project-specific processing files (local only)
#
# SHARING PHILOSOPHY:
# ‚úÖ SHARED (External): Base models, fine-tuned models, training datasets, source code
# üè† LOCAL (Project): Raw artifacts, intermediate processing, virtual environments
#
# This separation aligns with OLMo's open mission by maximizing sharing of
# valuable artifacts while keeping temporary processing files local.

# Virtual environment (project-specific dependencies)
# Contains project-specific Python packages and configurations that are not 
# reusable across different environments or projects
venv/

# Data and results directories (project-specific intermediate processing)
# These contain temporary artifacts during the processing pipeline,
# not the valuable shareable outputs that go to HuggingFace/external models
data/          # Raw security artifacts (JSON/SARIF from GitHub Actions)
results/       # Intermediate analysis before final dataset creation

# Python cache files
# Standard Python development artifacts that should never be shared

# Note: Models are stored externally at ~/shared-olmo-models/ and are not .gitignored
# Note: Final datasets are published to HuggingFace for community sharing
# Note: Source code (*.py, *.yaml configs) are tracked in git for full portability
