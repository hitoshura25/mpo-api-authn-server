# Main CI/CD Orchestrator Workflow
#
# This workflow orchestrates the entire CI/CD pipeline using callable workflows
# to eliminate workflow dispatch complexity and ensure reliable execution.
#
# ARCHITECTURE:
# 1. Build & Test: Runs unit tests, builds Docker images with smart change detection
# 2. E2E Tests: Runs only when Docker images are built, uses built images for integration tests
#
# BENEFITS:
# ✅ Eliminates 404 errors (workflows exist in PR branch)
# ✅ No PAT permission issues (direct calls)
# ✅ Modular, maintainable architecture
# ✅ E2E tests run in PRs when Docker images built
# ✅ Preserves all existing conditional logic and optimizations
#
# TRIGGERS:
# - Pull requests to main branch
# - Pushes to main branch
# - Manual dispatch with force options (UI)
#
# MANUAL FORCE OPTIONS:
# - Force full pipeline: Runs unit tests + Docker build + E2E tests + security scanning
# - Force Docker build: Runs Docker build + E2E tests (skips unit tests if no code changes)
# - Force unit tests: Runs unit tests only (skips Docker/E2E)
#
# EXECUTION FLOW:
# PR: build-and-test → e2e-tests (if Docker images built)
# Main: build-and-test → e2e-tests (if Docker images built)
# Manual: force options override smart change detection
