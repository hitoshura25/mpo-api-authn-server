          ## ü§ñ AI-Enhanced Vulnerability Update
          
          This PR was automatically generated by the **AI-enhanced vulnerability monitoring system**.
          
          ### üîç AI Enhancement Features
          - ü§ñ **Complete test implementations** (not just stubs) with AI-generated logic
          - üìä **Codebase-specific risk assessment** for each vulnerability
          - üîó **Library correlation analysis** with java-webauthn-server protections
          - üß™ **Attack simulation patterns** in generated tests
          - üìã **Prioritized recommendations** based on actual risk to our implementation
          
          ### Changes Made
          - ‚úÖ Added AI-generated vulnerability tests to `VulnerabilityProtectionTest.kt`
          - ‚úÖ Updated vulnerability tracking with enhanced analysis
          - ‚úÖ Ran existing security test suite to ensure compatibility
          - ü§ñ Enhanced with codebase-specific security analysis
          
          ### New Vulnerabilities Detected
          Details include AI analysis of impact on our specific WebAuthn implementation.
          Check the commit messages and vulnerability-tracking.json for comprehensive analysis.
          
          ### Testing Quality
          - [x] All existing security tests pass
          - [x] New vulnerability tests include complete implementations
          - [x] AI-generated tests include attack simulation
          - [ ] Manual security review recommended (despite AI enhancement)
          
          ### AI Analysis Results
          üîç **Security Analysis**: Each vulnerability assessed against our KTor + Yubico architecture  
          üß™ **Test Quality**: AI-generated tests include realistic attack scenarios  
          üìä **Risk Assessment**: Prioritized by actual impact on our implementation  
          
          ### Next Steps
          1. Review AI analysis results for each vulnerability
          2. Validate AI-generated test implementations 
          3. Check if any immediate actions are required
          4. Run security tests: `./gradlew test --tests="*VulnerabilityProtectionTest*"`
          5. Merge when security review complete
          
          **‚ö†Ô∏è This PR includes AI-enhanced analysis but still requires human security review**
