**Coverage:**
- API security testing
- Authentication bypass attempts
- Session management vulnerabilities
- Real-world attack simulation

**Integration:** Post-deployment testing in staging environment

### Layer 4: WebAuthn-Specific Security Testing
**Framework:** OWASP ASVS + Custom FIDO2 Tests

**Purpose:** WebAuthn/FIDO2 specific security validation

**Coverage:**
- Origin binding verification
- Credential replay protection testing
- User verification flow security
- FIDO2 compliance validation

**Integration:** Specialized test suite for authentication server

### Layer 5: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Security
**Recommended Tool:** Checkov

**Purpose:** Container and infrastructure configuration security

**Coverage:**
- Dockerfile security best practices
- Docker-compose configuration issues

- Network security configuration

**Integration:** Pre-build infrastructure validation

## WebAuthn/FIDO2 Specific Security Considerations

### 2024 Security Research Findings

**Key Security Advantages:**
- Cryptographic credentials unique across websites
- Credentials never leave user's device
- No server-side credential storage
- Origin-specific credential binding prevents phishing
- Asymmetric cryptography reduces credential theft risk

**Recent Vulnerability Research:**
- 2024 study: "Breaching Security Keys without Root: FIDO2 Deception Attacks via Overlays"
- Focus on limited display authenticator vulnerabilities
- Emphasis on multi-layer security approaches

### WebAuthn Security Testing Requirements

**Critical Test Areas:**
1. **Authentication Flow Validation**
   - Single factor passwordless flows
   - Multi-factor authentication scenarios
   - User verification (UV) configuration

2. **Browser/Platform Compatibility**
   - Cross-browser authentication testing
   - Platform authenticator integration
   - Fallback mechanism validation

3. **Attestation & Verification**
   - Attestation statement validation
   - Certificate chain verification
   - Trust anchor validation

4. **Recovery & Backup Testing**
   - Multiple authenticator registration
   - Recovery procedure validation
   - Backup authenticator failover

### Implementation Security Requirements

- Best of both worlds
- Focused commercial investment
- Retained flexibility

## Future Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: SAST Integration (Highest Impact)
**Timeline:** 1-2 weeks
**Tools:** Semgrep integration
**Benefits:** Source code security analysis currently missing

### Phase 2: Enhanced Container Security

**Tools:** Add Grype, enhance current Trivy setup
**Benefits:** Broader vulnerability detection

### Phase 3: DAST Implementation
**Timeline:** 2-3 weeks
**Tools:** OWASP ZAP integration

**Tools:** Checkov integration
**Benefits:** Infrastructure configuration security

## Conclusion

The current Trivy-based security setup provides solid container security foundation. The most impactful enhancement would be adding SAST (Semgrep) for source code analysis, followed by DAST for runtime testing. The OWASP ASVS framework provides an excellent structured approach for WebAuthn-specific security requirements.

**Recommendation:** Implement the multi-layered open-source approach when ready to enhance security capabilities, starting with SAST integration for immediate source code security benefits.
