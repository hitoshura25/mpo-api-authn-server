# Separated Storage Interfaces - Implementation Summary

## ✅ **What Was Accomplished**

I successfully separated the storage of registration requests and assertion requests into separate interfaces, providing
better separation of concerns and modularity.

## 🔧 **New Architecture**

### **Separate Interfaces Created:**

1. **`RegistrationRequestStorage`** - Handles only WebAuthn registration requests
    - `storeRegistrationRequest(requestId, options, ttlSeconds)`
    - `retrieveAndRemoveRegistrationRequest(requestId)`
    - `close()`

2. **`AssertionRequestStorage`** - Handles only WebAuthn assertion/authentication requests
    - `storeAssertionRequest(requestId, request, ttlSeconds)`
    - `retrieveAndRemoveAssertionRequest(requestId)`
    - `close()`

### **Implementations for Each Interface:**

**Redis Implementations:**

- `RedisRegistrationRequestStorage` - Redis storage for registration requests (key prefix: `webauthn:reg:`)
- `RedisAssertionRequestStorage` - Redis storage for assertion requests (key prefix: `webauthn:auth:`)

**In-Memory Implementations:**

- `InMemoryRegistrationRequestStorage` - In-memory storage for registration requests
- `InMemoryAssertionRequestStorage` - In-memory storage for assertion requests

## 🚀 **Benefits Achieved**

1. **Better Separation of Concerns** - Registration and assertion logic are completely separated
2. **Independent Scaling** - Can configure different storage backends for each type if needed
3. **Clearer Code Structure** - Each interface has a single, well-defined responsibility
4. **Type Safety** - No mixing of registration and assertion request types
5. **Easier Testing** - Can mock and test each storage type independently
6. **Future Flexibility** - Can easily extend or modify one storage type without affecting the other

## 🔄 **Dependency Injection Updated**

The Koin DI module now provides:

- Separate beans for `RegistrationRequestStorage` and `AssertionRequestStorage`
- Both interfaces support the same configuration (Redis/Memory)
- Both use the same environment variables for configuration

## 📝 **Application Changes**

The main Application.kt now injects separate storage dependencies:

```kotlin
val registrationStorage: RegistrationRequestStorage by inject()
val assertionStorage: AssertionRequestStorage by inject()
```

And uses them appropriately:

- Registration endpoints use `registrationStorage`
- Authentication endpoints use `assertionStorage`

## ✅ **Testing Verified**

All tests are passing, confirming:

- ✅ Dependency injection works with separated interfaces
- ✅ Memory storage implementations work correctly
- ✅ Configuration validation works for both storage types
- ✅ All WebAuthn functionality continues to work as expected
- ✅ Error handling works correctly for both storage types

## 🎯 **Result**

Your WebAuthn server now has a clean, modular architecture with separated storage concerns that maintains all the
scalability benefits while providing better code organization and type safety!
