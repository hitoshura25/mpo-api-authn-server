# Useful test execution examples:
# pytest                                    # Run all tests sequentially
# pytest -n auto                          # Run tests in parallel (auto-detect cores)
# pytest -n 4                             # Run tests with 4 parallel workers
# pytest -m "not slow"                    # Skip slow tests for development
# pytest -m "not training"                # Skip training tests specifically
# pytest -m "upload"                      # Run only upload tests
# pytest tests/integration/               # Run only integration tests
# pytest --durations=10                   # Show 10 slowest tests
