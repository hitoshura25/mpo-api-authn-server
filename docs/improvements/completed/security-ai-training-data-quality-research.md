# Security AI Training Data Quality Research & Implementation Strategy

**Document Date**: 2025-10-02
**Research Scope**: Security tools providing vulnerability detection + automated fix/remediation suggestions
**Objective**: Improve training data quality for self-healing security AI model to achieve 0.7+ validation threshold

## Executive Summary

### Current State
- **Stage 2 Validation Score**: 0.42 (below 0.7 threshold)
- **Root Cause**: 80%+ of security fixes use generic templates rather than real code analysis
- **Limited Real Fix Data**: Only ZAP provides actual remediation guidance from existing tools

### Key Research Findings
1. **Commercial Solutions Available**: Snyk Agent Fix (80% accuracy), GitHub Advanced Security (90% alert coverage), SonarQube AI CodeFix (GPT-4o powered)
2. **API Access Limited**: Most automated fix APIs restricted to enterprise customers or not publicly documented
3. **FOSS Options Growing**: Buttercup (DARPA award winner), limited but emerging automated fix capabilities
4. **Integration Feasible**: All major tools support programmatic access for vulnerability + fix data collection

### Strategic Recommendation
**Hybrid Approach**: Integrate commercial tool fix data for high-quality training examples while maintaining enhanced templates as fallbacks, targeting 70%+ real fix data coverage.

   - Field: `solution` with remediation guidance
   - Quality: Human-curated security recommendations

2. **Enhanced Template System**: Improve existing templates with context awareness
   - Current: Generic Dockerfile templates
   - Proposed: Parse actual container content for targeted fixes

### Medium Feasibility (Requires Investigation)
1. **Snyk CLI Integration**:
   - Command: `snyk fix` for automated vulnerability remediation
   - Output: Structured fix suggestions in JSON format
   - Requirement: Snyk account + potential enterprise features

2. **SonarQube API**:
   - Enterprise Edition required for AI CodeFix access
   - Trial/pilot evaluation needed for API endpoint discovery
   - Cost: Enterprise licensing fees

### Low Feasibility (Enterprise Requirements)
1. **GitHub Advanced Security API**:

## Training Data Quality Assessment

### Current Quality Issues
1. **Template-Based Fixes** (80%+ of output):
   ```json
   {
     "code": "// TODO: Implement secure authentication\n// Original vulnerable code preserved"
   }
   ```

2. **Path Mismatches**:
   - Trivy: Docker image names (`hitoshura25/webauthn-server`)
   - Expected: File paths containing 'dockerfile'
   - Result: Container security falls back to generic templates

3. **Limited Context**: Generic fixes without code-specific analysis

### Proposed Quality Improvements

#### Tier 1: High-Quality Real Fixes (Target: 40% of training data)
- **Source**: Snyk Agent Fix, GitHub Advanced Security
- **Quality**: AI-generated, context-aware, validated fixes
- **Languages**: JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, Python, Kotlin
- **Integration**: API/CLI-based data collection

#### Tier 2: Curated Human Guidance (Target: 30% of training data)
- **Source**: ZAP solutions, SonarQube rules, OWASP guidelines
- **Quality**: Expert-curated remediation guidance
- **Coverage**: Web security, infrastructure, compliance
- **Integration**: Existing artifact parsing + external knowledge bases

#### Tier 3: Enhanced Templates (Target: 30% of training data)
- **Source**: Improved context-aware template system
- **Quality**: Code-specific generic fixes with real file analysis
- **Coverage**: Container security, dependency updates, configuration fixes
- **Integration**: Enhanced parser logic + AST analysis

## Implementation Recommendations

### Phase 1: Immediate Improvements (1-2 weeks)
1. **Fix Path Mismatch Issue**:
   ```python
   # Update trivy_parser.py to use 'dockerfile://' prefix
   if vulnerability_type == 'container':
       file_path = f"dockerfile://{image_name}"
   ```

2. **Expand ZAP Integration**:
   - Extract solution fields from all ZAP reports
   - Create structured fix templates from solution text
   - Map solutions to vulnerability categories

3. **Enhanced Template Context**:
   - Parse actual Dockerfile content for FROM statements
   - Generate specific fixes based on base image analysis
   - Include version-specific remediation guidance

### Phase 2: Commercial Tool Integration (2-4 weeks)
1. **Snyk CLI Pilot**:
   - Set up Snyk account and evaluate free tier capabilities
   - Test `snyk fix` command with project codebase
   - Assess output quality and API access options
   - Cost analysis for potential enterprise upgrade

2. **GitHub Advanced Security Evaluation**:
   - Enable GitHub Advanced Security trial

           pass

       def generate_enhanced_template(self, vulnerability):
           # Context-aware template generation
           pass
   ```

2. **Quality Validation System**:
   - Automated fix quality scoring
   - Cross-tool validation (multiple tools suggest same fix)
   - Human review workflow for high-impact fixes

3. **Training Data Synthesis**:
   - Combine real fixes with enhanced templates
   - Maintain vulnerability category distribution
   - Ensure balanced representation across security domains

### Phase 4: Production Integration (2-3 weeks)
1. **MLX Training Pipeline Updates**:
   - Update sequential_fine_tuner.py to handle mixed data sources
   - Implement quality-weighted training (higher weight for real fixes)
   - Add validation metrics for fix quality assessment

2. **Monitoring and Feedback**:
   - Track Stage 2 validation score improvements
